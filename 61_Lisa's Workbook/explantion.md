I created the workbook function to count special problems in a workbook. I used page to track the current page and special to count matches. For each chapter, I looped through its problems. If the problem number matched the page number, I increased special. Whenever the page was filled or I reached the last problem, I moved to the next page. In the end, I returned the total special problems.
