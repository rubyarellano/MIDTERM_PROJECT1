I created the marsExploration function to count how many letters in the received message are different from the expected repeating pattern "SOS". I looped through each character in the string and compared it to the correct letter using i % 3 to cycle through "S", "O", and "S". Every time a character didnâ€™t match, I increased count. In the end, I returned count as the number of altered letters.
