I created the anagram function to find the minimum number of changes needed to make two halves of a string into anagrams. If the string length is odd, I returned -1 since it canâ€™t be split evenly. Otherwise, I split it into two halves, counted the character frequencies in the first half, and then checked the second half against it. For every character not found, I increased changes. Finally, I returned the total changes required.
