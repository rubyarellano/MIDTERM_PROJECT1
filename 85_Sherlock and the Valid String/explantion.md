I made the isValid function to check if a string is "valid," meaning all characters occur the same number of times or can be made valid by removing just one character. First, I counted the frequency of each character, then counted how many times each frequency appeared. If all characters had the same frequency, I returned "YES". If there were more than two different frequencies, I returned "NO". Otherwise, I checked special cases: one character appearing once, or one character having a frequency just 1 higher than the rest. If these conditions held, I returned "YES", else "NO".
