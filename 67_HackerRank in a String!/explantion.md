I made the hackerrankInString function to check if the word "hackerrank" appears as a subsequence inside a given string. I used a pointer j to track progress through the target word. As I looped through the input, each time a character matched the current target letter, I moved j forward. If j reached the end of "hackerrank", I returned "YES". Otherwise, after finishing the loop, I returned "NO".
