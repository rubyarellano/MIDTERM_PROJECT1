I created the palindromeIndex function to find the index of the character that can be removed to make a string a palindrome. I first wrote a helper function isPalindrome to check if a string is a palindrome. Then, I compared characters from both ends moving inward. If a mismatch was found, I tested removing either the left or right character. If one of those made it a palindrome, I returned that index; otherwise, I returned -1. If no mismatch was found, I also returned -1.
