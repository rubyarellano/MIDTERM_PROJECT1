I created the `kaprekarNumbers` function by looping through each number from `p` to `q` and squaring it using `BigInt` to handle large values. I split the square into left and right parts based on the number of digits in `n`, converted them to numbers, and checked if their sum equals `n`. If so, I collected it as a Kaprekar number and printed all results or "INVALID RANGE" if none were found.
