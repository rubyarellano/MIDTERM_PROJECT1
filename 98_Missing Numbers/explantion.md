I started by creating a frequency map of all the numbers in brr because that array contains the full set of numbers. Then, I looped through arr and subtracted one from the frequency of each number I found, since those are the numbers that appear in both arrays. After that, I checked the frequency map and collected all numbers that still had a positive count, because those are the missing numbers. Finally, I sorted the result in ascending order and returned it.
