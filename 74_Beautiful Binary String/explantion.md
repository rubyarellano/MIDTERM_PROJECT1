I created the beautifulBinaryString function to count how many changes are needed to remove the pattern "010" from a binary string. I looped through the string, and whenever I found "010", I increased the changes counter and skipped the next two characters (since that pattern was already handled). Otherwise, I just moved one step forward. In the end, I returned the total number of changes.
