I created the alternate function to find the longest string that can be formed by using only two characters from the input and making sure they strictly alternate. First, I collected all unique characters from the string. Then, I compared every possible pair of characters, filtering the string to only those two. For each filtered string, I checked with isAlternating to ensure no two adjacent characters were the same. If valid, I updated maxLength with the longest alternating length found. Finally, I returned that maximum length.
