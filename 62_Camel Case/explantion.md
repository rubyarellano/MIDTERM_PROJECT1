I created the camelcase function to count how many words are in a camelCase string. I started with count = 1 because the first word doesnâ€™t begin with a capital letter. Then, I looped through each character in the string. Whenever I found an uppercase letter (between 'A' and 'Z'), I increased the count since it marks the start of a new word. Finally, I returned the total count of words.
