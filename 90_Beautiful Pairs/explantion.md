I created the beautifulPairs function to count the maximum number of matching pairs between arrays A and B. I looped through A and looked for a matching element in B that hadnâ€™t been used yet, marking it once paired. After counting all matches, I checked if all elements of A matched. If so, I returned count - 1 (since one must change), otherwise I returned count + 1 (since one change can create an extra match).
