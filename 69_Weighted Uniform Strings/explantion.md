I made the weightedUniformStrings function to check if certain weights exist in a string. I looped through the string while tracking repeated characters. For each character (and its streak length), I calculated its weight using (char code – 96) × count and stored it in a Set. After building all possible weights, I went through each query and returned "Yes" if the weight was found or "No" if not.
