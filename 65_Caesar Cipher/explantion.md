I created the caesarCipher function to encrypt a string using Caesarâ€™s cipher. I first reduced the shift k with % 26 so it stays within the alphabet. Then, I looped through each character: if it was uppercase, I shifted its ASCII code relative to 'A'; if it was lowercase, I did the same relative to 'a'. Non-alphabetic characters were left unchanged. Finally, I built the shifted string and returned it as the encrypted result.
