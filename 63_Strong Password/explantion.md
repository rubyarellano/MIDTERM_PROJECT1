I made the minimumNumber function to check how many characters need to be added to make a password strong. I defined sets of numbers, lowercase, uppercase, and special characters. Then, I checked if the password had at least one of each type; if not, I increased the need counter. After that, I compared need with the minimum length requirement (6 characters) using Math.max, and returned the larger value as the number of characters still required.
