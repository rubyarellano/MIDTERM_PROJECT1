I first found the largest key in the array so I would know how many buckets to create. Then I made an array of empty buckets for each possible key. As I looped through the input, I placed a "-" in the bucket if the index was in the first half, or the actual value if it was in the second half. After filling the buckets, I combined everything into one array and joined them into a single string as the result.
